# Instructions

In this assignment, I'm a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I'm tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I'll analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. This is a template notebook; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given.

# About the Dataset

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken fromÂ [here](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-wwwcourseraorg-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDA0101ENSkillsNetwork20235326-2022-01-01).
